1,ARAD1,"Probable arabinosyl transferase responsible for the polymerization of arabinose into the arabinan of arabinogalactan. May function as inverting enzyme using UDP-beta-L-arabinopyranoside. May be important for arabinan side chains of rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), a major component of pectins. Cell wall pectic arabinans are involved in thigmomorphogenesis response of inflorescence stems to mechanical stress.",https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q6DBG8/entry,47655894,8,1
7,MADS3,"Probable transcription factor involved in the development of floral organs. Acts as C-class protein in association with MADS58. Involved in the control of lodicule number (whorl 2), stamen specification (whorl 3) and floral meristem determinacy (whorl 4), but not in the regulation of carpel morphogenesis. Plays a more predominant role in controlling lodicule development and in specifying stamen identity than MADS58.",https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q40704/entry,16170493,11,1
7,PDP3,"Together with PDP1, PDP2 and PDP6, interacts with MSI4/FVE and MSI5 to suppress FLC, MAF4 and MAF5 expression by regulating the function of the PRC2 complex and modulating H3K27me3 level, thereby promoting flowering.",https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9FNE4/entry,42040618,20,0
7,MYB13,Plays a regulatory role in meristem function. Functions as component of a regulatory network controlling the establishment and/or development of the shoot system by the regulation of apical meristem function,https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9LNC9/entry,44423319,17,0
7,CKL10,Protein kinase involved in blue light responses (e.g. hypocotyl elongation and flowering) by phosphorylating CRY2 to reduce its stability.,https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q93Z18/entry,44844351,14,0
7,CYP734A1,Cytochrome P450 involved in brassinosteroids (BRs) inactivation and regulation of BRs homeostasis. Inactivates the BRs castasterone (CS) and brassinolide (BL) through carbon 26 hydroxylation. Acts in association with CYP72C1 to inactivate BRs and modulate photomorphogenesis.,https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O48786/entry,45322125,11,0
13,CBL1,"Acts as a calcium sensor involved in the signaling pathway during growth and development and in response to abiotic stresses. May function as a positive regulator of salt and drought responses and as a negative regulator of cold response. Contributes to the regulation of early stress-related CBF/DREB transcription factors. CBL proteins interact with CIPK serine-threonine protein kinases. Binding of a CBL protein to the regulatory NAF domain of a CIPK protein lead to the activation of the kinase in a calcium-dependent manner. Mediates the activation of AKT1 by CIPK proteins (CIPK6, CIPK16, and CIPK23) in response to low potassium conditions and in the context of stomatal movement. Involved in response to glucose and gibberellin during germination and seedling development and in response to cold stress. Involved in the calcium-dependent regulation by CIPK26 of reactive oxygen species production by the NADPH oxidase RBOHF.",https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O81445/entry,4303898,20,0
13,FER,"Receptor-like protein kinase that mediates the female control of male gamete delivery during fertilization, including growth cessation of compatible pollen tubes ensuring a reproductive isolation barriers, by regulating MLO7 subcellular polarization upon pollen tube perception in the female gametophyte synergids. Required for cell elongation during vegetative growth, mostly in a brassinosteroids- (BR-) independent manner. Acts as an upstream regulator for the Rac/Rop-signaling pathway that controls ROS-mediated root hair development. Seems to regulate a cross-talk between brassinosteroids and ethylene signaling pathways during hypocotyl elongation. Negative regulator of brassinosteroid response in light-grown hypocotyls, but required for brassinosteroid response in etiolated seedlings. Mediates sensitivity to powdery mildew (e.g. Golovinomyces orontii). Positive regulator of auxin-promoted growth that represses the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling via the activation of ABI2 phosphatase. Required for RALF1-mediated extracellular alkalinization in a signaling pathway preventing cell expansion.7 Publications",https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9SCZ4/entry,36479735,12.5,0
